# T03: UI Design and Paper Prototyping

In this teamwork, You will explore the process of creating sketches and developing a paper prototype for your project in order to take your UI design to the next level.

*This teamwork should be completed in your project groups. Add the names of your team members here:*

## Learning Objectives:

- Practice sketching and developing your User Interface
- Apply design principles and usability knowledge to create a satisfactory prototype for your project
- Test your prototype and make changes


## Step 1: Paper Prototyping

A prototype is a rough, preliminary version of your app. It takes more work to produce a prototype than a sketch. You usually want to create a prototype to test your app with users before investing a lot of time in coding.

You can watch this video https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yafaGNFu8Eg to have an idea of what the paper prototype is supposed to look like at the end. 

Paper prototypes are the go-to method for designers to test apps and webpages. They allow you test interactions and user flow. You will often find problems with the signifiers, mapping, and conceptual model of your app in this step. Because it’s paper, it is simple and quick to fix these problems before the next test. Therefore, you can quickly improve your app design.

While creating the prototype, Discuss with each other and make sure all your sketches and ideas make sense to everyone in your group!

**Create a paper prototype of your project using your wireframes and userflow from PM04 and upload an image of it here**

## Step 2: Usuability Testing

Paper prototypes are made to change. You might change it over and over again until the testers seem to understand how they should complete tasks in your app.

To test your prototype, you're going to conduct a usuability test. Watch this video https://www.youtube.com/watch?time_continue=100&v=9wQkLthhHKA&feature=emb_logo to understand how it should be conducted.

You have been conducting informal usability tests up to this point, by asking those around you if your sketches and prototype ideas make sense. Now you're going to conduct a formal one, if all questions are positive, then you’re ready to start coding your app!

**Test your prototype with more than one neighbor and list all the points where the user didn't understand what they should do or areas where you think there can be an improvement**
:exclamation: **TODO**
```
1. 
2. ...
```

**Based on your list, Discuss how you can change these areas of your prototype to avoid any confusion and provide the user with a better experience**
:exclamation: **TODO**
```
```

**After you're done with making changes, Test your prototype with a different neighbor and continue to make changes afterwards if necessary**

## Step 3: Reflect
In this assignment you explored the creation and testing of the paper prototype for your project. Describe your thought processes or challenges you encountered while working on these problems.

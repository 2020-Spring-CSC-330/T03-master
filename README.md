# T03: UI Design and Paper Prototyping

In this teamwork, you will developing a paper prototype for your project application to refine the design and conduct low-cost usability testing.

*This teamwork should be completed in your project groups. Add the names of your team members here:*

## Learning Objectives:

- Apply design principles to refine the user interface of your application
- Conduct preliminary evaluation of the usability of the user interface 

## Step 1: Paper Prototyping

A prototype is a preliminary version of your app. It may not have full functionality, but it should give your user an approximate experience to the final product. Althought it takes more work to produce a prototype than a sketch or a wireframe, prototypes are valuable because they allow you to test the interactions and user flow before investing a lot of time in coding.

You can watch [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yafaGNFu8Eg) to have an idea of what the paper prototype is supposed to look like at the end. 

You will often find problems with the signifiers, mapping, and conceptual model of your app in this step. Because itâ€™s paper, it is simple and quick to fix these problems before the next test. Therefore, you can quickly improve your app design.
While creating the prototype, discuss with each other and make sure all your sketches and ideas make sense to everyone in your group!

**Create a paper prototype of your project using your wireframes and userflow from PM04. Upload a video of one of your team members demonstrating the user flows included in your complete prototype **

## Step 2: Usability Testing

A paper prototype's primary value is to demonstrate the application layout and interactions to users, and invite concrete feedback. Paper prototypes are made to change. In fact, presenting a paper version of the app will encourage users to make suggestions and offer more useful feedback that they might not give you with a more finished app. Each update of your prototype should include feedback from your peers and your target users.

To get meaningful feedback, you will conduct a "cognitive walkthrough" with your team and peers. In this style of test, the user puts themself in your client's shoes and attempts to complete a desired task through the interface.

This 15 minute video lecture gives a brief description and examples of a cognitive walkthrough:
- [User Interface Design - Cognitive Walkthrough (Coursera)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcBPSmDW-Dc)

Alternatively, you can read this article about how to conduct this evaluation:
- [Interaction-Design.org article about usability testing.](https://www.interaction-design.org/literature/article/how-to-conduct-a-cognitive-walkthrough)

- Bonus: Watch [this video of a usability test for a child's coloring app](https://www.youtube.com/watch?time_continue=100&v=9wQkLthhHKA&feature=emb_logo) to understand the benefits of using a paper prototype for a usability test.

The cognitive walkthroughs should identify all obvious usability errors. This will save your clients time and effort when you take the prototype to them for feedback.

**The section below documents your usability test. 
Conduct cognitive walkthroughs with 1 member of your team, and at least 2 classmates not on your team. After each test, make any needed changes to improve your design. Continue testing until a user can go through without error.**

**For each test, list out all the points where the user didn't understand what they should do or areas where you think there can be an improvement.**
:exclamation: **TODO**
```
User 1: <name>
1. Issue 1
2. Issue 2
3. ...
```

**Based on the list above, summarize the changes you will make to improve usability**

## Step 3: Reflect
In this assignment you explored the creation and testing of the paper prototype for your project. Describe your thought processes or challenges you encountered while working on these problems.

## Submission instructions

1. Commit and push your README, and any supporting materials (i.e. images).
2. Merge any branches you created to the master branch.
3. This repository should be updated by the due date listed on the [course website](https://trello.com/b/ROMbkFYs/2020-spring-csc-330).
